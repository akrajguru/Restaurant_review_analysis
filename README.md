# Restaurant_review_analysis

This project performs predictive analysis of restaurant businesses using three regression models: Random Forest, Decision Trees, and ElasticNet. 

Dataset: Zomato (Bangalore) https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FfkudQPaDnw-679s0Z8IS7ghhASiKBDS/view?usp=sharing

The results generated by these models are further compared by calculating the root mean square errors on the test and training dataset. Followed by this, the project tries to use sentiment analysis on the text reviews posted by users to improve the prediction analysis. 

For analyzing the user reviews, two models have been used, VADER and RoBERTa. 

After a successful comparison of results generated by both models, RoBERTa gave promising results. These results are attached to the cleaned data and passed through all the regression models again by adding a sentiment analysis field and evaluated.

Conclusion:

1. Random forest performed better than the Decision Trees model
2. We could see a difference between the importance given to each factor in both models.
3. ElasticNet introduces regularization, which avoids overfitting the Model.
4. Roberta Performed much better than Vader.
5. The values after considering sentiment analysis showed better results.
